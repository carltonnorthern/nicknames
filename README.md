# Nicknames

A hand-curated CSV file containing English given names (first names) and
their associated nicknames.

There are Python, SQL, Java, Perl, and R parsers provided for convenience.

This is a relatively large list with roughly 1100 canonical names. Any help from
people to clean this list up and add to it is greatly appreciated.
The first name in a line is the canonical name, and the rest are nicknames
for that name.

This lookup file was initially created by mining this
[genealogy page](https://www.caagri.org/nicknames.html) from the
*Center for African American Research, Inc*.
Because the lookup originates from a dataset used for genealogy purposes there
are old names that aren't commonly used these days, but there are recent ones
as well. Examples are "gregory", "greg", or "geoffrey", "geoff". There was also
a significant effort to make it machine readable, i.e. separate it with commas,
remove human conventions like "rickie(y)" would need to be made into two
different names "rickie", and "ricky". Due to the source of the original data,
the dataset is heavily biased towards traditionally African American names.
Names from other groups may or may not be present.

This project was created by [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) -
[Web Science and Digital Libraries Research Group](http://ws-dl.blogspot.com/).
More information about the creation of this lookup can be found on this

## Python API

The Python parser is available on PyPI from

```bash
pip install nicknames
```

and then you can do:

```python
from nicknames import NickNamer

nn = NickNamer()

# Get the nicknames for a given name as a set of strings
nicks = nn.nicknames_of("Alexander")
assert isinstance(nicks, set)
assert "al" in nicks
assert "alex" in nicks

# Note that the relationship isn't symmetric: al is a nickname for alexander,
# but alexander is not a nickname for al.
assert "alexander" not in nn.nicknames_of("al")

# Capitalization is ignored and leading and trailing whitespace is ignored
assert nn.nicknames_of("alexander") == nn.nicknames_of(" ALEXANDER ")

# Queries that aren't found return an empty set
assert nn.nicknames_of("not a name") == set()

# The other useful thing is to go the other way, nickname to canonical:
# It acts very similarly to nicknames_of.
can = nn.canonicals_of("al")
assert isinstance(can, set)
assert "alexander" in can
assert "alex" in can

assert "al" not in nn.canonicals_of("alexander")

# You can combine these to see if two names are interchangeable:
union = nn.nicknames_of("al") | nn.canonicals_of("al")
are_interchangeable = "alexander" in union
```
